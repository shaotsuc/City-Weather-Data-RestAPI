# Rest API & ELT Project | City Weather data

<br>

## Objectives
The main goal for me is to practice the ETL/ELT process of getting data via RestAPI with Python and its libraries, allowing it to load into DWH and transform to build a data model using dbt.

<br>

## Project Overview
### City Weather API Source
The city weather data is getting from WeatherAPI.com. Authentication method is API key.

### Python Library Used
| Main Library  |
| ------------- |
| Pandas        |
| requests      |
| python-dotenv |
| os            |

### Weather Data Pipeline

## Loaded into BigQuery 
After extracting the desired cities weather, I loaded into BigQuery as a seed file.

## Transforming in dbt
After loading into BigQuery, itâ€™s time to transform the seed dataset into staging  dataset. Then logically, I could do more data models based on the business requirements.

```sql
-- stg_city_weather data model
{{ 
    config(
            materialized='table',
            schema='city_weather'
        ) 
}}
